The HBNB Console repository

The project aims at creating a replica of the AirBnB website. This phase introduces a backend interface, referred to as a console, that facilitates data management within the program. Through the console, users have the capability to create, modify, and delete objects, in addition to handling file storage. The use of JSON for serialization and deserialization ensures that data storage is maintained persistently across sessions.

Comprehensive Guide to Using the HBNB Console
Getting Started with the HBNB Console

To begin interacting with the HBNB project, the first step is to clone the project repository to your local machine. Once the cloning process is complete, navigate to the directory containing the "console.py" file. You can start the console interface by executing the following command in your terminal:

/AirBnB_clone$ ./console.py

Upon successful execution, you will be greeted by the prompt:
(hbnb)
This prompt signifies your entry into the HBNB console environment, where you are equipped with various commands to interact with the program's data.

Essential Console Commands

Within the HBNB console, the following commands are at your disposal:

create: This command generates a new instance of the specified class.
Usage: create <class_name>

destroy: This command removes an object based on its class and unique identifier (UUID).
Usage: destroy <class_name> <class_id>

show: This command displays an object's details, identified by its class and UUID.
Usage: show <class_name> <class_id>

all: This command lists all objects accessible by the program or all objects of a specified class.
Usage: all [<class_name>]

update: This command modifies an object's attributes, identified by class name and UUID.
Usage: update <class_name> <class_id> <attribute_name> "<attribute_value>"

quit and EOF: Both commands exit the program.

Additionally, it's possible to invoke commands in an object-oriented manner using the syntax <class_name>.<command>(arguments).

Command Examples in Practice

Creating an Object

To create a new instance of a class, use:

(hbnb) create BaseModel
Upon creation, the console will output the new object's UUID.

Showing an Object's Details - To display the details of an object, specify its class name and ID:

(hbnb) show BaseModel <UUID>
The console will then present the object's attributes, including its creation and last updated timestamps.

Destroying an Object - To remove an object from storage, provide its class name and ID:
(hbnb) destroy BaseModel <UUID>

Verifying the deletion by attempting to show the object will result in a "no instance found" message.

Updating an Object - Updating an object requires specifying the class name, ID, the attribute to update, and the new value:
(hbnb) update BaseModel <UUID> first_name "person"

Reviewing the object after the update will display the new attribute value.

Through these examples and commands, users can effectively manage and manipulate the data within the HBNB console, making it a powerful tool for backend data management in the initial stages of building an AirBnB clone website.
